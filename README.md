# BitForecast: Next-Hour Price Predictor

The models provide BTC forecasts for the next few hours relative to time T0, which is updated every 10 hours or sooner if the models crash unexpectedly. Both models refresh every few minutes; however, occasional hiccups may occur, causing delays in the next release due to:

<ul>
    <li>Issues retrieving data from live sources</li>
    <li>Lack of convergence with certain data inputs</li>
</ul>
 
After several iterations, the models usually recover, and the latest model (indicated by orange dots) should generally follow the average trend.

Please note that these models are experimental and should be used with caution. They do not constitute financial advice, and any decisions based on them are at your own risk. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees in this volatile market.

We are continuously working on new architectures and improving our current models. If you find this tool helpful, please consider supporting us at our BTC wallet:
